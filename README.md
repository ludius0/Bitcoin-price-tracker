# Bitcoin-price-tracker

This time I programmed Bitcoin price tracker. As ultimate challange to test my knowledge with python and tkinter I tried to write something, which outstand my other projects and I am happy with result. Finally I properly learned programming in oop style nad didn't had many issues as like with 2048 game (previous project). As API I used CoinDesk which I entagled in second script (data), where I generaly unwrap data and in first script (main) put them on screen.

The program show price in real time (USD and EURO -> I could do other currencies, but I already wanted to move on another project) and also show historical price of BTC (in USD), where you can also type date which you would like to look for (Don't go further than your date now or older than 2013-09-01)
